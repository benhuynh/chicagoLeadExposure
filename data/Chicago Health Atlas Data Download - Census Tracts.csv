A score of 0 represents a perfectly homogenous community; the higher the score, the more economically diverse the area. The highest possible score is 0.833, not 1.","Income in the past 12 months.","The Hardship Index is a composite score reflecting hardship in the community (higher values indicate greater hardship). It incorporates unemployment, age dependency, education, per capita income, crowded housing, and poverty into a single score that allows comparison between geographies. It is highly correlated with other measures of economic hardship, such as labor force statistics, and with poor health outcomes. See technical notes for details.","Percent of residents reporting a cognitive difficulty.","Percent of residents with a disability, defined as one or more sensory disabilities or difficulties with everyday tasks.","The Social Vulnerability Index was created to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event, such as a natural disaster, disease outbreak, or chemical spill. SVI indicates relative vulnerability by ranking places on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and combining the rankings into a single scale from the 0th percentile (lowest vulnerability) to 100th percentile (highest vulnerability).","The most serious offenses, also known as index crimes. Includes homicide, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, burglary, larceny, vehicle theft, and arson.","Percent of occupied housing units with more than one occupant per room (e.g. three occupants in a one-bedroom apartment).","Percentage of renter-occupied housing units with an eviction over the past year. An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters. This is based on available eviction records and estimates for missing data, and does not include voluntary move-outs or evictions that take place outside of the legal system. A high eviction rate could be based on a high number of evictions, a very low number of renter-occupied units, or both.","Households spending more than 30% of income on rent are considered rent-burdened. Rent costs do not include utilities, insurance, or building fees.","","Annual average concentration in micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5, or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter, is one of the most dangerous pollutants because the particles can penetrate deep into the alveoli of the lungs.","Percent of residents who have low access to food, defined solely by distance: further than 1/2 mile from the nearest supermarket in an urban area, or further than 10 miles in a rural area.","Percent of residents without health insurance (at the time of the survey)."
